        <p>Hi, my name is Ashlee. I've been dog sitting for several years now.<br><br> I'm so grateful to be able be a pet sitter because my daughter and I get to play with so many different dogs and cats. We currently have 3 cats, and a ferret of our own. My daughter is 12, and she is a big animal lover. My love for animals started as a child.  I grew up in the countryside in the midwest and we always had dogs and cats, and I also had a cockatiel bird named Ozzie for a while.</p><br>

        <p>As for me I'm a mom, a full-time employee, and a part-time student. I'm blessed to be able to work from home four out of five days a week. My schooling is very time consuming but since I'm learning computer programming, I get to do fun things like creating websites. And as you can see, this website is a work in progress! ðŸš§<br><br>
            
            I do have a busy life, but when I'm pet sitting I devote all my free time with the animals in my house. Every morning the dogs and cats get fed before I even get my coffee. ðŸ™‚<br><br>
        </p>

        <p>It's always good to bring your own pet bed, crate, favorite toy, etc. Dogs are always initially more comfortable to have something to remind them of home. If you don't have a designated bed, they are welcome to sleep wherever they want in my home.</p><br>
        <p>If I do get the chance to care for your pet, feel comfortable knowing that they are treated like part of our family and not in a boarding environment!</p><br>  
        <p>I always make sure my house is tidy and I always keep an eye on the dogs when I let them outside in the backyard. Keeping the pets safe, healthy, and HAPPY are my top priorities.</p><br>
